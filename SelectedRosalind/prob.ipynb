    "An array is a structure containing an ordered collection of objects (numbers, strings, other arrays, etc.). We let A[k] denote the k-th value in array A. You may like to think of an array as simply a matrix having only one row.\n",

    "A random string is constructed so that the probability of choosing each subsequent symbol is based on a fixed underlying symbol frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "GC-content offers us natural symbol frequencies for constructing random DNA strings. If the GC-content is x, then we set the symbol frequencies of C and G equal to x2 and the symbol frequencies of A and T equal to 1−x2. For example, if the GC-content is 40%, then as we construct the string, the next symbol is 'G'/'C' with probability 0.2, and the next symbol is 'A'/'T' with probability 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many probabilities wind up being very small. In order to work with small probabilities, we may plug them into a function that \"blows them up\" for the sake of comparison. Specifically, the common logarithm of x (defined for x>0 and denoted log10(x)) is the exponent to which we must raise 10 to obtain x.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Figure 1 for a graph of the common logarithm function y=log10(x). In this graph, we can see that the logarithm of x-values between 0 and 1 always winds up mapping to y-values between −∞ and 0: x-values near 0 have logarithms close to −∞, and x-values close to 1 have logarithms close to 0. Thus, we will select the common logarithm as our function to \"blow up\" small probability values for comparison.\n",

    "\n",
    "Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[k] represents the common logarithm of the probability that a random string constructed with the GC-content found in A[k] will match s exactly."
